	       ***Protocol by Simon SÃ¶rensen for arduino controlled devices***
*********************************************************************************************
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Send corresponding strings to devices-server for activation.
Ex: turning on the outdoor lighting is done by sendig string "m0111" to devices-server

Outdoor lighting on/off              --> m0111/m1111
Timer 1 on/off                       --> m0100/m1100
Heating element on/off               --> m0101/m1101
Heating element wind on/off 	     --> m0110/m1110
Indication burlgar alarm lamp on/off --> m0011/m1011
Indoor lighting on/off               --> m0010/m1010
Timer 2 on/off 			     --> m0001/m1001
Sound on/off			     --> m1000/m0000
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Send corresponding strings to devices-server for feedback.
Ex: checking the outdoor temperature is done by sending the string "d9" to the devices-server

Check outside temperature 	     --> d9
Check inside temperature	     --> a1
Check inside temperature attic       --> a2
Check LDR (light reader)	     --> a3

**Correspons to 1/0**
Fire alarm active/inactive 	     --> r2
Burglar alarm inactive/active	     --> r3
Waterleakage active/inactive	     --> r4
Stove on/off			     --> r5
Window open/closed		     --> r6
Power outage active/inactive 	     --> r7
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Send corresponding strings to devices-server for modulating input amount (0-255 = 0-100%).
Ex: turning on the inside fan at roughly 50% speed is done by sending string "p127"

Fan 				     --> p[value 0-255]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEWARE!
There are more commands that can be sent, but has no useful functionality. Such commands could for
example be write commands for controllers that only support reading. Digital pin 2 can be read
by sending 'r2' as seen from the protocol above, however you can also send 'd21' to write value
1 to digital pin 2, but since pin 2 does not have any device accepting inputs, it is useless.
Do not send useless commands to the arduino.
