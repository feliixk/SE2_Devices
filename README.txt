Send corresponding strings to devices-server for ACTIVATION.
Ex: turning on the outdoor lighting is done by sendig string "m0111" to devices-server

Outdoor lighting on/off              --> m0111/m1111 *
Timer 1 on/off                       --> m0100/m1100
Heating element on/off               --> m0101/m1101 ***
Heating element wind on/off 	     --> m0110/m1110
Indication burlgar alarm lamp on/off --> m0011/m1011
Indoor lighting on/off               --> m0010/m1010
Timer 2 on/off 			     --> m0001/m1001
Sound on/off			     --> m1000/m0000 **

All alarms on/off                    --> b1/b0
Burglar alarm on/off                 --> i01/i00 (includes window check)
Fire alarm on/off                    --> i11/i10
Water leakage alarm on/off           --> i21/i20
Power outage alarm on/off            --> i31/i30 (not yet implemented)
Automatic light on/off 		     --> i41/i40 
Automatic heating on/off	     --> i51/i50 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Send corresponding strings to devices-server for FEEDBACK.
Ex: checking the outdoor temperature is done by sending the string "r9" to the devices-server

Check outside temperature 	     --> r9 (no longer works)
Check power consumption		     --> a0 (works)
Check inside temperature	     --> a1 (no longer works)
Check inside temperature attic       --> a2 
Check LDR (light reader)	     --> a3 (works occasionally)
Check stove ontime (ms)		     --> r8

**Correspons to 1/0**
Fire alarm active/inactive 	     --> r2
Burglar alarm inactive/active	     --> r3
Waterleakage active/inactive	     --> r4
Stove on/off			     --> r5 
Window open/closed		     --> r6
Power outage active/inactive 	     --> r7 (not yet implemented)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Send corresponding strings to devices-server for MODULATING INPUT AMOUNT
Ex: turning on the inside fan at roughly 50% speed is done by sending string "p127"
Ex: setting the ddesired temperature to 22.5 degrees is done by sending string "t225"

Fan 				     --> p[value 0-255] (0-255 = 0-100%)
Desired inside temperature           --> t[value 150-300]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional information regarding devices.

House automatic systems now do two things upon activation; they trigger the system in
the house (alarms can be manually accessed by "m1000/m0000") and they also send a message to
the internal server that an alarm has been activated. This message can then be used to
inform further up the chain. The arduino informs about
what system has gone off according to the scheme below:

Burglary alarm has gone off          --> "bAlarm" will be sent if activated by door opening
				     --> "wAlarm" will be sent if activated by window opening
Fire alarm has gone off              --> "fAlarm" will be sent
Water leakage has been detected      --> "wLeakage" will be sent
Stove has been one too long          --> "sAlarm" will be sent
Indoor heating element has activated --> "ihOn" will be sent if it turned itself on
				     --> "ihOff" will be sent if it turned itself off
Outside light has activated          --> "outOn" will be sent if it turned itself on
				     --> "outOff" will be sent if it turned itself off

If an alarm is activated, it can either be turned off using "b0" (as seen in the ACTIVATION
part above) which turns off all alarms, or by using the alarms individual alarm activation
command such as "i00" for the burglary alarm. Alarms are by default on and will be off until
re-activation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEWARE!
There are more commands that can be sent, but has no useful functionality. Such commands could for
example be write commands for controllers that only support reading. Digital pin 2 can be read
by sending 'r2' as seen from the protocol above, however you can also send 'd21' to write value
1 to digital pin 2, but since pin 2 does not have any device accepting inputs, it is useless.
Do not send useless commands to the arduino.

*Outdoor lighting is mainly controlled via a lightsensor that is checked at a certain
interval. You can turn it off with the command "i40"
**Turning on sound will immediately beep the alarm sound in the smart house without an actual
alarm being triggered. This may interfere with alarm functionality. Use at own risk.
***Heating element is mainly controlled via temp sensor that is checked at a certain time
interval. You can turn it off with the command "i50"
